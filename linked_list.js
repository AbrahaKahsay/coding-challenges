// LinkedList is the dynamic data structure, as we can add or remove elements at ease, 
// and it can even grow as needed. Just like arrays, linked lists store elements sequentially, 
// but donâ€™t store the elements contiguously like an array. 

// User defined class node
class Node {
	// constructor
	constructor(element)
	{
		this.element = element;
		this.next = null
	}
}
